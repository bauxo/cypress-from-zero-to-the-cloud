# Checking (and unchecking) inputs of type `checkbox`

As you might have guessed, to check inputs of type `checkbox`, we are also going to use the `.check()` command.

After selecting an element of type `checkbox`, just chain the `.check()` command.

For example: `cy.get('input[type="checkbox"]').check()`.

To uncheck them, use the [`.uncheck()`](https://on.cypress.io/uncheck) command.

For example: `cy.get('input[type="checkbox"]').uncheck()`.

> 👨‍🏫 `.click()` also works for inputs of type `checkbox`, however, I recommend using `.check()` or `.uncheck()`.
>
> By using `.check()`, we are sure it will check the checkbox, even if it's already checked. And by using `.uncheck()`, we're sure it will uncheck the checkbox, even if it's already unchecked. **This makes tests more deterministic**.

## Exercise

1. Create a test called `checks both checkboxes, then unchecks the last one`.
2. The test must ensure that both checkboxes have been checked, and then that the last one ([`.last()`](https://on.cypress.io/last)) has been unchecked.
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

## Extra exercise

1. Review the test called `displays an error message when the phone becomes required but is not filled in before the form submission`, to ensure that, instead of a `.click()`, the `.check()` command is used to check the phone checkbox.
2. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.
