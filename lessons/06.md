# Uploading files with Cypress

On [version 9.3.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-3-0), Cypress released the [`.selectFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/selectfile) command.

This functionality, as the name suggests, is used for selecting files.

Such a command is useful when we need to include an attachment to a form  , as the TAT CSC application allows us to do.

You can use `cy.get('input[type="file"]')` to identify a file selection field, and chain the `.selectFile()` command, passing to it the relative path of the file you intend to upload (based on the project’s root directory.)

For example: `cy.get('input[type="file"]').selectFile('cypress/fixtures/example.json')`

> 👨‍🏫 Althought the content mentions the [`cypress-file-upload`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-file-upload) plugin, it also mentions the new `.selectFile` command, so read it untill the end. After all, it's good know it exists.

## Exercise

1. Create a test called `selects a file from the fixtures folder`.
2. The test should verify that, after file selection, the correct file's `name` is persisted in the `files` object of the `input` of type `file`.
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

## Extra exercise 1

1. Create a test called `selects a file simulating a drag-and-drop`.
2. The test should verify that, after file selection, the correct file's `name` is persisted in the `files` object of the `input` of type `file`.
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

## Extra exercise 2

1. Create a test called `selects a file using a fixture to which an alias was given`.
2. The test should verify that, after file selection, the correct file's `name` is persisted in the `files` object of the `input` of type `file`.
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.
