# Course structure

Below, you will find everything you need to know to benefit 100% from the course's content.

## Concept and examples

At the beginning of each lesson, I outline the concept to be covered.

> 👨‍🏫 For example: uploading files with Cypress.

In this section, I take the most common situations found in the world of web test automation, and present Cypress features that solve certain use cases.

> 👨‍🏫 In the above case, for example, I would mention the [`.selectFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/selectfile) functionality, with examples of its usage.
>
> By the way, we will see this functionality in detail in [lesson 6](./06.md).

## Suggested contents and links to the documentation

In many lessons, there are suggested contents and links to the official documentation at your fingertips.

## Instructor's tips 👨‍🏫 (and spoilers 🙊)

In some exercises, you will see the instructor emoji, or the monkey with its mouth closed.

When it's the instructor emoji (👨‍🏫), it's just a reminder.

When it's the monkey emoji  (🙊), there's some spoiler to help you.

## Exercises

I believe that practice leads to perfection.

Therefore, at the end of each lesson, there are exercises for you to put the new knowledge into practice.
