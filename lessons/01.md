# Your first automated test with Cypress

When writing automated tests for web applications, the first step is to visit the URL of the AUT.

For this, Cypress has the [`cy.visit()`](https://on.cypress.io/visit) command.

To visit a web page with Cypress, simply pass the desired URL as a string to the `cy.visit()` command.

For example: `cy.visit('https://google.com')`.

## Suggested contents

During the course, instead of testing the TAT CSC application running on the internet, we will test a local version, i.e. the `src/index.html` file.

Therefore, I recommend reading the following content before moving on, in addition to the official Cypress documentation:

- [How to visit a page that is on my computer with Cypress](https://dev.to/walmyrlimaesilv/how-to-visit-a-page-that-is-on-my-computer-with-cypress-29ee)
- https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit#Visit-local-files

## Exercise

1. Inside the `cypress/e2e/TAT-CSC.cy.js` file, add the following basic structure for your test suite:

```js
describe('TAT Customer Service Center', () => {
  it('checks the application title', () => {

  })
})

```

> 👨‍🏫 The `describe` block defines the test suite, and the `it` block defines the test case.

2. Inside the callback function of the `it` block, add the code that visits the application (via the relative path `./src/index.html`), and check that its title is `TAT Customer Service Center`.

> 👨‍🏫 For the title verification, read about the [`cy.title()`](https://on.cypress.io/title) functionality from the Cypress official documentation.
>
> Also, read about the [`.should()`](https://on.cypress.io/should) functionality.

3. With the test created, modify the `scripts` section of the [`package.json`](../package.json) file, as follows:

```json
"scripts": {
  "cy:open": "cypress open",
  "test": "cypress run"
},

```

4. Finally, in the command line terminal, in the project root (or in the VS Code shortcut), execute the command `npm run cy:open` to open the Cypress App and run the new test in interactive mode. Move on only when the test is passing.
