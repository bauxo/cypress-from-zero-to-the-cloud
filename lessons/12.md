# Advanced Cypress features

And now that you know the basics, I'm going to show you some advanced features, just so you can "get a taste" of what else Cypress empowers you to do.

## Control the browser's "clock" 🕐 with the `cy.clock()` and `cy.tick()` commands

With the [`cy.clock()`](https://on.cypress.io/clock) command, you can "freeze" the browser's clock. 🧊

And with the [`cy.tick()`](https://on.cypress.io/tick) command, you can jump ahead in time. 🕒

For example:

```js
it('displays a message for 3 seconds', () => {
  cy.clock() // freeze the browser clock

  // (...) // action that triggers something that displays a message for three seconds

  // (...) // checking that the message is visible

  cy.tick(3000) // advances the clock by three seconds (in milliseconds). In doing so, we don't need to keep waiting.

  // (...) // checking that the message is no longer visible
})
```

### Exercise

In the tests that check messages (success and error), use the `cy.clock()` and `cy.tick()` functionalities, to verify not only that the messages appear, but also, that they disappear after 3 seconds, however, without having to wait for 3 seconds (saving time in the tests' execution).

## lodash ([`Cypress._`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/_))

[lodash](https://lodash.com) is a world famous JavaScript library with several utility functions.

The cool thing is that Cypress already bundles `lodash` with it, through the `Cypress._` module.

Some of my favorite features of lodash are:

- [`Cypress._.times()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#times)

> 👨‍🏫 The `_.times()` functionality allows you to execute a callback function a certain number of times, where the number of times is the first argument, and the callback function is the second.

For example:

```js
_.times(3, () => {
  console.log('Hello, Cypress!')
}) // This will log 'Hello, Cypress!' three times to the console.

```

- [`Cypress._.repeat()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#repeat)

> 👨‍🏫 The `_.repeat()` functionality is used for repeating a string a certain number of times, where the first argument is the string that you want to repeat, and the second argument is how many times that string should be repeated.

```js
const repeatedText = _.repeat('lorem ipsum, ', 3)

console.log(repeatedText) // This will log 'lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum, ' to the console.
```

### Extra exercise 1

Try the `Cypress._.times()` functionality in one of the tests, to understand its usage and practice.

> 🙊 Use it to run the same test multiple times.

## Invoke element attributes and methods with the [`.invoke()`](https://on.cypress.io/invoke) command

We saw `.invoke()` in the lesson [Handling links that open in another browser tab](./07.md), to remove the `target` attribute from an element, preventing the page from opening in another tab when clicked.

Two other uses of `.invoke()` that I want you to know about are:

- `.invoke('show')`
- and `.invoke('hide')`

With the `.invoke('show')` command, you can force the display of an HTML element that is hidden with `display: none;`

And with the command `.invoke('hide')`, you can hide an element that is being displayed.

### Extra exercise 2

1. Create a test called `displays and hides the success and error messages using .invoke()`
2. 🙊 The test must have the following structure:

```js
it('displays and hides the success and error messages using .invoke', () => {
  cy.get('.success')
    .should('not.be.visible')
    .invoke('show')
    .should('be.visible')
    .and('contain', 'Message successfully sent.')
    .invoke('hide')
    .should('not.be.visible')
  cy.get('.error')
    .should('not.be.visible')
    .invoke('show')
    .should('be.visible')
    .and('contain', 'Validate the required fields!')
    .invoke('hide')
    .should('not.be.visible')
})

```

3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

### Extra exercise 3

You can also invoke (and set) the value of an input or text area field using the `.invoke` command (e.g., `cy.get('textarea').invoke('val', 'some-value')`.)

So...

1. Create a test called `fills in the text area field using the invoke command`.
2. The test should make use of the `.invoke()` command to fill in the text area field.

> 🙊 `cy.get('#open-text-area').invoke('val', 'some text')`

3. Verify that the value is actually persisted in the field.

> 🙊 `.should('have.value', 'some text')`

4. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

## [`cy.request()`](https://on.cypress.io/request)

One of Cypress's greatest features is the ability to execute commands at the network level.

Meet `cy.request()`. 🦸🏽‍♂️

With the `cy.request()` command, you can execute HTTP requests at the network level, saving time in the setup of tests and focusing on what matters when it comes to testing things through the graphical user interface (GUI).

If you want, you can even use the `cy.request()` command to purely test [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) APIs.

### Extra exercise 4

1. Create a test called `makes an HTTP request`.
2. The test must make use of the `cy.request()` command, to send a `GET` request, to the following URL: `https://tat-csc.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html`.
3. Assert that the `status` returns `200`, the `statusText` returns `OK`, and the `body` includes the string `TAT CSC`.
4. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.
