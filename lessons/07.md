# Handling links that open in another browser tab

[Cypress only works in one browser tab](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/trade-offs#Multiple-tabs).

> At least until the moment of this writing.

Many see this as a limitation and do not seek to understand how to get around such a situation.

However, depending on what you need to test, this might not be as difficult as you think.

In the TAT CSC application, we have a link to the privacy policy, which, when clicked, opens that page in a new browser tab.

How to test such a page?

Or, what alternatives do I have at my disposal?

I will present you with two alternatives, however, in the [official documentation](https://on.cypress.io/), you will find even more.

## Alternative 1 - trust the browser works (test the application, not the browser)

If an anchor element (`<a>`) has the `target` attribute with the value `_blank`, when clicked, the value of the `href` attribute will be opened in a new tab. This is the default behavior in any browser.

In this case, we can simply check such a characteristic, without even having to click the element.

For example:

`cy.get('.some-link').should('have.attr', 'target', '_blank')`

## Alternative 2 - remove the `target` attribute from the element

If you need to go to the other page, Cypress lets you remove the `target` property from the anchor element.

For that, I present you the [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke) command.

With the `invoke()` command, you can do: `cy.get('#link-that-opens-in-another-tab').invoke('removeAttr', 'target')`.

> 👨‍🏫 It is worth mentioning that, for this alternative to work, the page that usually opens in another tab must be on the same domain (or sub-domain) of the AUT. Otherwise, you might want to look at the [`cy.origin`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) command.

## Exercise

1. Create a test called `verifies that the privacy policy page opens in another tab without the need for a click`.
2. The test must use the alternative 1 demonstrated above.
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

## Extra exercise 1

1. Create a test called `access the privacy policy page by removing the target, then clicking on the link`.
2. The test must use the alternative 2 demonstrated above.
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

## Extra exercise 2 - Challenge

1. Create a test called `independently test the privacy policy page`.
2. Use your creativity and the features you have learned so far to carry out this test (the solution is simpler than you might think.)
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.
