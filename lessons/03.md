# Selecting options in drop-down select fields

For the selection of options in dropdown fields, Cypress provides the [`.select()`](https://on.cypress.io/select) command.

With this command, you can identify the `select` element (e.g., `cy.get('select')`), and then, chain the `.select()` command, passing to it the content of of the HTML option; the `value` attribute; or the index.

For example:

- `cy.get('select').select('Blog') // Selection by the content 'Blog'`
- `cy.get('select').select('youtube') // Selection by the value 'youtube'`
- `cy.get('select').select(1) // Selection by the index 1`

> 👨‍🏫 If the field allows multiple choices, you can even pass the values ​​you want to select, listing them in an [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array). This is not the case with the TAT CSC application, but it's good to know!

## Exercise

1. Create a new test called `selects a product (YouTube) by its content`.
2. Check that after selection, such an option was actually selected (`.should('have.value', 'value-here')`).
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

## Extra exercise 1

1. Create a new test called `selects a product (Mentorship) by its value`.
2. Check that after selection, such an option was actually selected (`.should('have.value', 'value-here')`).
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

## Extra exercise 2
