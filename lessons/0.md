# Fork and clone the project 🐑

1. Open the browser and visit the URL https://github.com/wlsf82/cypress-from-zero-to-the-cloud.
2. [Fork]((https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)) the project's repo.

> 👨‍🏫 It is important that you work on your fork, so that at the end of the course, you can run the tests in a workflow of continuous integration.

3. In your project fork, click the **Code** button, choose the clone via SSH option, and copy the project clone link.

> For details on creating and configuring an SSH key on GitHub, read the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).

4. In your command line terminal (in a folder where you store your software projects), run the command `git clone [paste-the-copied-link-here]`.

> 👨‍🏫 To ensure you're cloning your fork correctly, check for your GitHub username in the project's clone URL. It should look like the following `git@github.com:[your-username-here]/cypress-from-zero-to-the-cloud.git`.

5. After the project is cloned, access the newly cloned directory (`cd cypress-from-zero-to-the-cloud/`).

> **Note:** Inside the `cypress-from-zero-to-the-cloud/` directory, you should have the subdirectories `.git/` (hidden directory), `lessons/` and `src/`, and the files `.gitignore` (hidden file), `LICENSE`, `package.json`, and `README.md`.
>
> Inside the `src/` directory, you should see the files `index.html`, `privacy.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`. These are the source code of the application we are going to test.

## Install and launch [Cypress](https://cypress.io) 🌲

1. From the root of the project, run the command `npm install cypress@13.1.0 --save-dev` (or `npm i cypress@13.1.0 -D` for the short version).
2. Run the command `npx cypress open` to open Cypress for the first time, and let it guide you through the creation of an end-to-end (E2E) testing suite.
3. Finally, with Cypress App open, create a file called `TAT-CSC.cy.js` and close Cypress App.

> **Note 2:** When first started, Cypress automatically creates the `cypress.config.js` file and the `cypress/` directory, with its subdirectories  `e2e/`, `fixtures/`, and `support/`, with their respective files.

## Extra configuration

1. Update the `cypress.config.js` file as follows.

```js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  viewportHeight: 880,
  viewportWidth: 1280,
  e2e: {},
})

```

> 👨‍🏫 With the above, we're "telling" Cypress that we will override the height and width of [Cypress's default viewport](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport#Defaults).

2. Done!

Congrats! let's go to [lesson 1](./01.md) to write the first test.
