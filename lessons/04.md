# Checking `radio` input fields

Another common element in web applications is the input of type `radio`.

Inputs of type `radio` are single selection elements.

In the TAT CSC application, these are the elements for selecting the type of service, where the default value is the first field (Help) and the other options are: Praise and Feedback.

To deal with inputs of type `radio`, Cypress has the functionality [`.check()`](https://on.cypress.io/check).

After selecting an element of type `radio`, just chain the `.check()` command.

For example: `cy.get('input[type="radio"]').check()`.

> 👨‍🏫 `.click()` also works for inputs of type `radio`; however, I recommend using `.check()`, for robustness and semantics.

## Exercise

1. Create a test called `checks the type of service "Feedback"`
2. Make sure the correct value is selected after the `.check()` (🙊 `.should('be.checked')`).
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

## Extra exercise

1. Create a test called `checks each type of service`.
2. Make sure that after `.check()`, each `radio` has been checked.
3. Run the new test in the Cypress App, and when it passes, move on.

> 👨‍🏫 For the Extra exercise solution, I recommend reading the documentation of both [`.each()`](https://on.cypress.io/each) and [`cy.wrap()`](https://on.cypress.io/wrap) commands.

Congrats! Let's go to [lesson 5](./05.md) to learn how to check (and uncheck) inputs of type `checkbox`.
