# Project documentation

Any automated testing project must have sufficient documentation so that a newcomer can quickly understand what is going on.

Here is a list of what I value in a documentation:

- A brief description of what the project is about
- Prerequirements for both production and test environments (such as Node.js, npm, git, etc.)
- Steps to install the dependencies
- Steps to run the tests
- Any other information that might be relevant

In several of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/wlsf82), you will find this pattern.

Feel free to copy one of my [`README.md`](https://github.com/wlsf82/cy-alias/blob/main/README.md) files, and adapt it to the course, or any of your projects.

## Exercise

Create a documentation for the course's automated testing project and push it to GitHub.

> 👨‍🏫 This way, you can show the world that you care not only about well-written but also well-documented code.

## Show the world what you've learned

To show your professional network what you've learned so far, post the following on LinkedIn.

> I'm going through the "Cypress, from Zero to the Cloud" course, from the Talking About Testig online school, where I learned how to write concise yet useful project documentation. #TalkingAboutTesting #TATSchool #CypressFromZeroToTheCloud #Cypress

Congrats! Let's go to [lesson 10](./10.md) to learn how to set up a continuous integration workflow that runs tests whenever changes occur in the application (or testing) code.
